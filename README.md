## Industrial Copper Modeling

#### Introduction:
The Problem Statement about copper industry deals with data related to product quantity, width, thickness, country, selling price etc., However, this data  suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data. 

Here, we are guided to build two Machine Learning models to predict Selling price and Status. Selling Price is a continuous variable, so used Regression model for prediction. Whereas, Status, is a categorical variable, so used Classification Model.

This dataset contains more noise and linearity between independent variables so it will perform well only with tree based models.

So, I decided to go with Decision Tree Regressor and Decision Tree Classifier algorithms for model building. 

Finally, one of the two predicted model should be display in Streamlit Web Application for the user purpose, so that the user can feed some values and get the results either the Selling Price or the Status.

#### Libraries Used:

* import pandas as pd 
* import numpy as np 
* import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
* import seaborn as sns
* from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
* from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
* from sklearn.compose import make_column_selector as selector
* from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
* from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
* from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
* from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix,classification_report
* from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
* import pickle
* import streamlit as st

#### Data Preprocessing:

- Handle Null values
- Clean the noisy data mainly Material reference column
- Mixed datatypes conversion
- conversion of numeric values
- Handle zero , non positive values

#### EDA:
- Visualization on selling price over period of time
- Checking for Outliers through Boxplot, Histplot
- Checking for Skewness in the dataset
- Transform the high positive skewness through log transformation approach
- Before and After Skewness through visualizations
- Correlation among the variables through Heat Map
- Encoding the necessary independent variables
- Used One hot encoder for encoding

#### Feature Engineering:
- HyperParameter tuning
- Grid SearchCV was used to get the best parameters

#### Model building and Evaluation:

Selling Price Prediction

* USed Decision Tree Regressor
* Did hyperparameter tuning and found Best Parametrets using grid serach CV approach
* Evaluate the model using R2 score, Mean Squared Error
* Provided new data points and predicted the selling_price
* Save the model using Pickle as a file

Status Prediction

* Used Decision Tree Classifier
* Got the accuracy score around 90%
* Evaluate the model using confusion matrix, precision score, f1 score.
* Provided new data points and predicted the status
* Save the model using Pickle as a file

##### Streamlit Application:

* Created the streamlit application to execute the saved model through pickle.
* The User can give the values to the fields and they can predict the Selling Price.
* The prediction is happening due to the already builded models.

Thank You All!
